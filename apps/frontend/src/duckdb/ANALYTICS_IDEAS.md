  - Risk score heatmap across projects
  - Timeline Gantt chart for project deadlines
  - Status distribution pie chart
- **Actions:**
  - Update project status
  - Adjust budget allocation
  - Mark projects as critical
  - Export project reports

### 2. **Task Analytics & Management**

- **Visualizations:**
  - Task burndown chart (completed vs remaining over time)

  - Time tracking: estimated vs actual hours (bar comparison)
  - Task dependencies network graph
  - Blocked tasks alert panel
- **Actions:**
  - Bulk reassign tasks
  - Update task status
  - Add/remove dependencies
  - Create subtasks
  - Log work hours

### 3. **Team Productivity Insights**
- **Visualizations:**
  - User workload distribution (hours logged per user)
  - Team member allocation percentage (stacked bar)
  - Department performance comparison
  - Work logs timeline (daily/weekly trends)
  - Availability vs utilization scatter plot
- **Actions:**
  - Rebalance workload
  - Assign users to teams
  - Update availability hours
  - Request additional resources

### 4. **Milestone Tracker**

  - Urgency level distribution
  - Request type breakdown
  - Response time metrics
- **Actions:**
  - Approve/reject requests
  - Assign resources
  - Set priority levels
  - Bulk process requests

### 6. **Notifications & Alerts Hub**
- **Visualizations:**
  - Notification timeline (recent activity)
  - Action required vs informational split
  - Notification type distribution
  - Read vs unread metrics
- **Actions:**
  - Mark as read/unread
  - Take action directly from notification
  - Filter by entity type
  - Bulk dismiss

### 7. **Time & Budget Intelligence**
- **Visualizations:**
  - Budget consumption trend line
  - Cost per task/project analysis
  - Time tracking heatmap (which days/hours are most productive)
  - Overtime alerts and patterns
- **Actions:**
  - Set budget alerts
  - Approve overtime
  - Reallocate funds
  - Export financial reports

### 8. **Compliance & Quality Dashboard**
- **Visualizations:**
  - Compliance required vs completed
  - Client-facing projects spotlight
  - Quality check status
  - Blocker reasons word cloud (from task_comments)
- **Actions:**
  - Mark compliance complete
  - Request compliance review
  - Add quality checkpoints
  - Resolve blockers

### 9. **Organization Overview**
- **Visualizations:**
  - Department hierarchy tree
  - Cross-department collaboration network
  - Team size comparison
  - Organization growth timeline
- **Actions:**
  - Create departments/teams
  - Restructure hierarchy
  - Transfer team members
  - Set department goals

### 10. **Smart Recommendations Engine**
- **Visualizations:**
  - Overdue tasks alert cards
  - At-risk projects (based on risk_score, budget, timeline)
  - Underutilized resources
  - Bottleneck detection (blocked tasks, dependencies)
- **Actions:**
  - Auto-suggest task reassignment
  - Recommend deadline extensions
  - Propose resource reallocation
  - Generate action plans

## üìê Component Design Guidelines

### Component Structure
- **Independent components** - No dependencies on other tsx components
- **Single card format** - Large, self-contained card with all functionality
- **ECharts integration** - Using CDN for visualizations
- **Action buttons** - Interactive elements for data manipulation
- **Design system compliance** - Following DESIGN_SYSTEM.MD guidelines

### Technical Requirements
- Use `queryExecutor` from `../query` for database operations
- Load ECharts dynamically via CDN
- Follow soft modern design aesthetic
- Responsive and accessible
- Error handling and loading states

### Visual Standards
- Colors: #6b8cce (blue), #6bcf7f (green), #ffd93d (yellow), #fc8181 (red)
- Border radius: 16px-20px for cards
- Shadows: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)
- Typography: Poppins/Inter font stack
- Spacing: 4px base unit
